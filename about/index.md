Hello!

I'm Pengrey. I'm a CS student and a infosec enthusiast.

As of Jully of 2021 I have been studying Infosec while I finish my CS bachelor's degree. This way I can build software by day and break software by night.

I'm currently taking my first steps to get some security related certs. 

The main porpuse of this blog is for me to share my experiences and try to give a bit back to the community that has been helping me greatly. Hope I can help you even if just a bit while being enjoyable.\
